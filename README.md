# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains machine learning models for stock price prediction implemented in Jupyter Notebook using various algorithms including Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM, and ARIMA.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for LSTM model)
- Statsmodels (for ARIMA model)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip installnumpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow statsmodels jupyter
```
## Getting Started
### Follow these steps to run the Jupyter Notebook on your local machine:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```
https://github.com/Hrut7hesh/Stock-Price-Predictor.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
```
cd stock-price-predictor
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
- In your browser, navigate to the URL shown in the terminal where Jupyter Notebook is running.

- Open the Stock svm and random forest.ipynb and Stockarima lstm.ipynb file.

- Follow the instructions and execute the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
## Notebooks Description
This notebook contains the implementation of machine learning models for stock price prediction using Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM, and ARIMA algorithms. It includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is not included in this repository due to its size and licensing restrictions. You can use your own dataset or obtain stock price data from various sources such as Yahoo Finance.
