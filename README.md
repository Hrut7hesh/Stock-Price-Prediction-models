# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains machine learning models for stock price prediction implemented in Jupyter Notebook using various algorithms including Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM, and ARIMA.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for LSTM model)
- Statsmodels (for ARIMA model)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow statsmodels jupyter
```
